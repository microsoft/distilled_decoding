# Model Card for Distilled Decoding

## Model Details

### Model Description

Image auto-regressive models have achieved impressive image generation quality, but they require many steps during the generation process, making them slow. **Distilled decoding models** distill pretrained image auto-regressive models, such as VAR and LlamaGen, to support few-step (e.g., one-step) generation. 

The models we are currently releasing are subsets of models in the [Distilled Decoding paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17153) that only support label-conditioned (e.g., cat, dog) image generation for ImageNet dataset. The labels are from a pre-defined list (1000 classes) from ImageNet. The models do NOT have any text-generation or text-conditioned capabilities. 

The list of the released models are: 

* VAR-DD-d16: The distilled decoding model for VAR-d16 model on ImageNet dataset 
* VAR-DD-d20: The distilled decoding model for VAR-d20 model on ImageNet dataset 
* VAR-DD-d24: The distilled decoding model for VAR-d24 model on ImageNet dataset 
* LlamaGen-DD-B: The distilled decoding model for LlamaGen-B model on ImageNet dataset 
* LlamaGen-DD-L: The distilled decoding model for LlamaGen-L model on ImageNet dataset 

We may release the text-to-image distilled decoding models in the future.

### Red Teaming
Our models generate images based on predefined categories from ImageNet. Some of the ImageNet categories contain sensitive names such as "assault rifle". This test is designed to assess if the model could produce sensitive images from such categories. 

We identify 17 categories from ImageNet that have suspicious keywords (attached below). For each of the 10 models (5 are trained by us, and the other 5 are the base VAR and LlamaGen models released) and the category, we generate 20 images. In total, we generate 10 x 17 x 20 = 3400 images. We manually go through the images to identify any sensitive content. 

We did not identify any sensitive image. 0% defect rate of 3400 prompts tested.

## Uses

### Direct Intended Uses 
Given a label (one of the pre-defined 1000 classes from ImageNet), the model can generate images from that label.  Distilled Decoding does not currently have real-world applications. It is being shared with the research community to facilitate reproduction of our results and foster further research in this area. 

### Out-of-Scope Uses

These models do NOT have text-conditioned image generation capabilities, and cannot generate anything beyond images. We do not recommend using Distilled Decoding in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. It is being released for research purposes. 

## Risks and Limitations
These models are trained to mimic the generation quality of pretrained VAR and LlamaGen models, but they might perform worse than those models and generate bad ImageNet images with blurry or unrecognizable objects. 

### Recommendations
While these models are designed to generate images in one-step, they also support multi-step sampling to enhance image quality. When the one-step sampling quality is not satisfactory, users are recommended to use enable multi-step sampling. 

## How to Get Started with the Model

Please see the GitHub repo for instructions: https://github.com/microsoft/distilled_decoding 

## Training Details

### Training Data
The training process fully relies on the pre-trained models, and does NOT use any external/additional datasets. 

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing
Firstly, we randomly sample noise sequences from a standard Gaussian distribution, and use the pre-trained image auto-regressive models and our proposed mapping methods to compute their corresponding image tokens. This way we can collect a set of (noise, image tokens) pairs. 

Next, we train a new model (initialized from the pre-trained image auto-regressive models) to output the images tokens directly with their corresponding noise as input.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors, and Metrics

#### Testing Data
ImageNet dataset

#### Metrics
Image quality metrics include FID, Inception Score, Precision, Recall 

### Evaluation Results

For VAR, which requires 10-step generation (680 tokens), DD enables one step generation (6.3× speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96 on ImageNet-256.  

For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8× speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35 on ImageNet-256. 

#### Summary
Overall, the results demonstrate that our Distilled Decoding models are able to achieve significant speed-up over the pre-trained VAR and LlamaGen models with acceptable image degradation on ImageNet datasets.
